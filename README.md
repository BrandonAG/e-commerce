## Description

Use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) commands to interface with a MySQL database using node and sequelize.

## Installation

First, install `Node.js 14` and `MySQL 8` or newer on your system. Then clone this repository and navigate to the local folder via command line. Next install the necessary packages with `npm install` at the root of local repository. See respective documentation in the links below.

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/)

* [Express](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install)

* [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)

## Usage

If running on your local machine, start the application using either of the following commands:

```
npm start
```

or

```
node server.js
```

Test out the CRUD functionality using a tool of your choosing. Enter `localhost:3001` along with the desired API routing information into the tool to create, read, update, or delete items.
